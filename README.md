## Subject :

Write an elf-anomaly tool that prints a list of checks to report the presence/absence of anomalies such as (no symbols info, session header table pointing beyond file data, wrong string table index, overlapping headers/segments, unusual entropy of a section, strange segment permissions, weird entry point, different interpreter, _start that does not call __libc_start_main,â€¦) The tool should also be able to (on demand) fix some of these issues (well, obviously the ones related to corrupted headers)

## All functions to implement :
### Asked
* no symbols info
* session header table pointing beyond file data
* wrong string table index
* overlapping headers/segments
* unusual entropy of a section
* strange segment permissions
* weird entry point
* different interpreter
* \_start that does not call \_\_libc\_start\_main

* option to fix some issues (related to corrupted headers)

* make it usable in command lines

### Other ideas
* check if section header

## Encore a faire
### Asked

* wrong string table index
* overlapping headers/segments
* unusual entropy of a section
* strange segment permissions
* weird entry point
* different interpreter
* \_start that does not call \_\_libc\_start\_main

* option to fix some issues (related to corrupted headers)



### Other ideas
* check if section header : Justine
### Needed :
* C programs with statically and dynamically linked libraries to make tests --> quite URGENT 

## En cours :
* session header table pointing beyond file data

## Fait :
* no symbols info 
* make it usable in command lines
